# Anomaly-Detection-in-BlockChain

## Data Set Used
We use the data big query link - hosted on the Google Cloud Platform which consists of the
bitcoin transaction data over a timeframe.
In order to access the data set and fetch the data, user has to pass the necessary access
credentials which can be done through the Credentials option under API and Services and
selecting service account key.

## Modules Used
I ran my code on the Google CoLab owing to some issues on the pyod module.
I have used certain outlier detection algorithms from the Pyod module -
